I love products that are made to be simply the best in their category. On this
page, I like to list some of these products, both _hardware_ (not limited to
devices) and software.


## Physical Things I like and love

- [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com) (coffee): It's plastic, unbreakable,
  pretty in its own way, cheap, and makes amazing coffee. What's more to like!
- [Victorinox Alox Farmer](https://victorinox.com) (pocket knife): Everyone
  should have a Swiss army knife, tailored to their specific requirements. My
  knife of choice is definitely one of the more sturdier Alox versions, and the
  Farmer has exactly what I need.
- [Casio](https://casio.com) (watch): Nerdy, aesthetically pleasing, and cheap
  but durable. You might start to notice a pattern here.
- [Boska Monaco+](https://boska.com/products/kaasschaaf-monaco-plus): Every
  Dutch household has a cheese grater in one of their kitchen drawers, and this
  one is made to be the absolute best one. And that without a premium price,
  love it!


## Software I like and love

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) (editor): Duh
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (terminal multiplexer): A terminal
  emulator and a multiplexer; name a better duo.
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) (CLI): Working with Git(Hub) is a breeze with
  this command line interface for GitHub.


## Small Quality of Life Apps

- MiddleClick.app
