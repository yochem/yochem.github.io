title: "Hammerspoon as MacOS Swiss Army Knife"

I'm a long-term MacOS user, and have always loved to tinker with software.
That's why I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io), add all my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/yochem/dotfiles) to GitHub, and use some apps to
significantly enhance the MacOS experience.

- `AltTab`: Changes the app switcher. I mainly use this because I want a window
  switcher that shows _all_ windows, not an app switcher that only lists the
  opened apps.
- `Karabiner Elements`: Remapping keys, like capslock to escape and creating a
  'hyper' key.
- `Logi Options+`: This also remaps some keys specific for my Logitech keyboard.
- `Middleclick`: Use three-finger taps on the trackpad as mouse middle click.
  Useful for closing tabs.
- `Rectangle`: Tiling windows with keyboard shortcuts.


- discovered hammerspoon
- _could_ be possible to replace all
- macos hidutil hack
- todo: logitech, middleclick probs not possible
